// Package vault is a simple tool to embed resource and asset files into a go binary.
// It generates go source files containing encoded and compressed resource files.
// The generated source code provides an api to retrieve the embedded resources without any additional dependencies
// and therefore the vault package is only needed to generate those source files.
//
// Documentation see https://github.com/go-sharp/vault
